		<p> I personally like liquid sugar painting or as people say it in chinese 糖画(It just mean sugar painting). Also if you haven't catch onto that i'm chinese...bravo. *claps* The reason why these pages have so much involvement with China is not just because i'm chinese, but for the fact that I vist China ever summer if I can. AND no I don't stop going to China just cause I need to go to summer school, for I never go to summer school. It's just some personal reason. I'm not sure why I shared that but it's just to probably give you a background on how fun it is to be in China. Chinese people are pretty creative and theres a lot of creative art pieces in food you buy, toys for children, or sweets! It's just fun to look at how people paint with liquid sugar on a piece of paper.</p>

I couldn't find any sugar painting of the original one like the gif above.<br><a href="#materials"> Materials you'll need</a><p> or </p><a href="#steps">Steps for making of cotton candy</a><p> or</p> <a href="#bottom"> Bottom of the page(not sure why but here it is)</a></p>
