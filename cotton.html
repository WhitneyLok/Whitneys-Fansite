    <p>Cotton candy is something I can eat all day long. Theres all types of cotton candy in China, they even make cotton candy in different shapes! It's super fun to watch the creation of cotton candy in China instead of watching people just roll it up like normal in Ny or many other places with cotton candy. Although i'm not sure if other places do, since y'know i'm a student and I can't travel around the world but i'm pretty sure they don't put effort in making cotton candy. I think going to China for most people can be fun, due to a lot of areas in China is old and unique.  <br><img src="https://sociorocketnewsen.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/cotton-candy-flower.jpg" height="500" width="600" alt="Cotton Candy"><br>
